	* make sure that you add some random text to your file.

* Explore the changes tab (left).

	* What happens if you add some more text to your file and save it?

* Now **commit**, i.e. take a snapshot of your project. 
	* at the bottom of the "changes" tab fill out the "summary" text box

* Finally, click on the top middle tab to Sync your repo back to GitHub (could say Fetch, or Push, or Pull)
